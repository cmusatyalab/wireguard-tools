# WireGuard-tools

Pure Python reimplementation of wireguard-tools with an aim to provide easily
reusable library functions to handle reading and writing of
[WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) configuration files as well as
interacting with WireGuard devices, both in-kernel through the Netlink API and
userspace implementations through the cross-platform UAPI API.


## Installation/Usage

```sh
    pipx install wireguard-tools
    wg-py --help
```

Implemented `wg` command line functionality,

- [x] show - Show configuration and device information
- [x] showconf - Dump current device configuration
- [ ] set - Change current configuration, add/remove/change peers
- [x] setconf - Apply configuration to device
- [ ] addconf - Append configuration to device
- [x] syncconf - Synchronizes configuration with device
- [x] genkey, genpsk, pubkey - Key generation


Also includes some `wg-quick` functions,

- [ ] up, down - Create and configure WireGuard device and interface
- [ ] save - Dump device and interface configuration
- [x] strip - Filter wg-quick settings from configuration


Needs root (sudo) access to query and configure the WireGuard devices through
netlink. But root doesn't know about the currently active virtualenv, you may
have to pass the full path to the script in the virtualenv, or use
`python3 -m wireguard_tools`

```sh
    sudo `which wg-py` showconf <interface>
    sudo /path/to/venv/python3 -m wireguard_tools showconf <interface>
```


## Library usage

### Parsing WireGuard keys

The WireguardKey class will parse base64-encoded keys, the default base64
encoded string, but also an urlsafe base64 encoded variant. It also exposes
both private key generating and public key deriving functions. Be sure to pass
any base64 or hex encoded keys as 'str' and not 'bytes', otherwise it will
assume the key was already decoded to its raw form.

```python
from wireguard_tools import WireguardKey

private_key = WireguardKey.generate()
public_key = private_key.public_key()

# print base64 encoded key
print(public_key)

# print urlsafe encoded key
print(public_key.urlsafe)

# print hexadecimal encoded key
print(public_key.hex())
```

### Working with WireGuard configuration files

The WireGuard configuration file is similar to, but not quite, the INI format
because it has duplicate keys for both section names (i.e. [Peer]) as well as
configuration keys within a section. According to the format description,
AllowedIPs, Address, and DNS configuration keys 'may be specified multiple
times'.

```python
from wireguard_tools import WireguardConfig

with open("wg0.conf") as fh:
    config = WireguardConfig.from_wgconfig(fh)
```

Also supported are the "Friendly Tags" comments as introduced by
prometheus-wireguard-exporter, where a `[Peer]` section can contain
comments which add a user friendly description and/or additional attributes.

```
[Peer]
# friendly_name = Peer description for end users
# friendly_json = {"flat"="json", "dictionary"=1, "attribute"=2}
...
```

These will show up as additional `friendly_name` and `friendly_json` attributes
on the WireguardPeer object.

We can also serialize and deserialize from a simple dict-based format which
uses only basic JSON datatypes and, as such, can be used to convert to various
formats (i.e. json, yaml, toml, pickle) either to disk or to pass over a
network.

```python
from wireguard_tools import WireguardConfig
from pprint import pprint

dict_config = dict(
    private_key="...",
    peers=[
        dict(
            public_key="...",
            preshared_key=None,
            endpoint_host="remote_host",
            endpoint_port=5120,
            persistent_keepalive=30,
            allowed_ips=["0.0.0.0/0"],
            friendly_name="Awesome Peer",
        ),
    ],
)
config = WireguardConfig.from_dict(dict_config)

dict_config = config.asdict()
pprint(dict_config)
```

Finally, there is a `to_qrcode` function that returns a segno.QRCode object
which contains the configuration. This can be printed and scanned with the
wireguard-android application. Careful with these because the QRcode exposes
an easily captured copy of the private key as part of the configuration file.
It is convenient, but definitely not secure.

```python
from wireguard_tools import WireguardConfig
from pprint import pprint

dict_config = dict(
    private_key="...",
    peers=[
        dict(
            public_key="...",
            preshared_key=None,
            endpoint_host="remote_host",
            endpoint_port=5120,
            persistent_keepalive=30,
            allowed_ips=["0.0.0.0/0"],
        ),
    ],
)
config = WireguardConfig.from_dict(dict_config)

qr = config.to_qrcode()
qr.save("wgconfig.png")
qr.terminal(compact=True)
```


### Working with WireGuard devices

```python
from wireguard_tools import WireguardDevice

ifnames = [device.interface for device in WireguardDevice.list()]

device = WireguardDevice.get("wg0")

wgconfig = device.get_config()

device.set_config(wgconfig)
```

## Bugs

The setconf/syncconf implementation is not quite correct. They currently use
the same underlying set of operations but netlink-api's `set_config`
implementation actually does something closer to syncconf, while the uapi-api
implementation matches setconf.

This implementation has only been tested on Linux where we've only actively
used a subset of the available functionality, i.e. the common scenario is
configuring an interface only once with just a single peer.
