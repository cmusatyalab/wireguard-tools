# WireGuard GUI

Welcome to the VPN Setup GUI project. This is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project aimed at helping small VPN operators set up their networks quickly and easily.

## Project Overview

Setting up a VPN can be a complex task, especially for small operators who may not have a dedicated IT team. This project aims to simplify that process by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up VPN networks.

With this tool, operators can configure their VPN networks without needing to understand complex networking concepts or write configuration files by hand. The GUI provides a simple, intuitive interface that guides operators through the setup process step by step.

We welcome contributions from the community. If you're interested in contributing, please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.

At present, the development roadmap is here [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
